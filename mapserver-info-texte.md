### Mountain view

The Mountain View viewpoint offers a perfect vista into the crater. This viewpoint is located on top of the large hill southeast of the crater.
From here, the observer can see that the northern part of the crater floor is sloping and that the northern crater rim is clearly less defined, compared to the flat, smooth crater floor in the south and the much steeper southern crater rim flanks.
This appearance originates from the erosion of material in the catchment areas to the north of the crater, which was then transported into the crater basin itself and deposited in the deltas.
Also contributing to the asymmetrical topography is the erosion of the northern crater rim, caused by the river valleys breaking through the flank of Jezero.

### Mars 2020 Rover “Perseverance” landing site

The NASA Mars 2020 mission is en route to Mars since July 30th 2020.
On board: The NASA rover “Perseverance”, the most complex equipment ever sent to Mars.
Besides numerous scientific instruments, it will carry containers for a drill core sample collection that will be left on Mars for a later return to Earth carried out by follow-up missions planned for the 2030s.
The approximately one metric ton heavy vehicle is set to land on 18 February 2021 at 21:55 CET in Jezero crater and will then start the search for traces of microbial life.
The working group at Freie Universitaet Berlin is involved with Prof. Jaumann, serving as Co-Investigator on the Mastcam Z instrument.
“Ingenuity” is the name of a 1.8 kg heavy helicopter drone onboard the rover that will be used as near field reconnaissance instrument.

### Pliva Vallis

Pliva Vallis in the east of Jezero Crater is the outflow channel through
which water was discharged from the crater. This is why this former crater
lake is referred to as an ‘open basin lake’. These lakes were once
numerous on Mars. Compared to closed basins (with inflow but no outflow),
they are interesting because they were freshwater lakes with a stable
water level. Lakes in closed basins, on the other hand, were subjected to
more frequent periods of drying out, which turned them into salt lakes,
thus making them less promising in the search for conditions that are
conducive to life.

### Delta basement or delta top

Volcanic minerals, carbonates and clay minerals have been found both in
the delta and elsewhere in the crater. Some carbonates are thought to have
been formed directly in the lake. Such lake carbonates and especially the
clay minerals indicate freshwater conditions that enable life and have the
potential to preserve biosignatures particularly well in their interior.
However, other types of minerals have also been discovered there, namely
those that paint a different picture of the crater lake. These include
sulphates that contain iron oxide, amorphous silicon oxides and
hydroxides, which tend to form in acidic waters that gradually dried up.
These minerals indicate that the environmental conditions in Jezero Crater
became drier and less conducive to life at a later stage. But even among
these minerals there are some in which biosignatures can be very well
preserved.

### Naretva Vallis

Neretva Vallis is an inflow channel that created a delta on the western
and northwestern rim of the crater, which are also considered evidence for
the existence of a former lake. Perseverance will examine the larger of
the two in the west in more detail.

### Sava Vallis

Sava Vallis is an inflow channel that created a delta on the western and
northwestern rim of the crater, which are also considered evidence for the
existence of a former lake. Perseverance will examine the larger of the
two in the west in more detail.

### Jezero Crater (center)

This is a view from the crater center at higher altitude. From here you
have a perfect overview over Jezero and can spot the delta, the inflow-
and the outflow channels in the distance. Also very well visible is the
asymetry of the crater. The rims of Jezero are pretty shallow in the
northeastern part and much steeper towards the south.

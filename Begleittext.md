# Working title Mars 2020 special PR: Jezero map and virtual views

This map and the 3D panoramic view was created using an image mosaics made from orbit observations of the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on board ESA’s Mars Express mission. It pictures Jezero crater and its surrounding area, the landing site of NASA’s rover “Perseverance”.

The working group of Planetary Science and Remote Sensing at Freie Universität Berlin used the image mosaics to create the mapserver shown here. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) operates the HRSC camera on Mars Express. The systematic processing of the camera data took place at the DLR Institute for Planetary Research in Berlin-Adlershof.


The NASA Mars 2020 mission is en route to Mars since July 30th 2020. On board: The NASA rover “Perseverance”, the most complex equipment ever sent to Mars. Besides numerous scientific instruments, it will carry containers for a drill core sample collection that will be left on Mars for a later return to Earth carried out by follow-up missions planned for the 2030s. The approximately one metric ton heavy vehicle is set to land on 18 February 2021 at 21:55 CET in Jezero crater and will then start the search for traces of microbial life. Our working group at FU-Berlin is also involved with Prof. Jaumann, serving as Co-Investigator on the Mastcam Z instrument.

“Ingenuity” is the name of a 1.8 kg heavy helicopter drone onboard the rover that will be used as near field reconnaissance instrument. Jezero crater was chosen for a good reason as landing site. Two ancient river deltas can be found inside the crater. Within the delta deposits, numerous water-bearing minerals have been found, indicating, that liquid water was once present for an extended period of time.

Jezero is a 49 km wide impact crater, bordering the giant Isidis impact basin and is Noachian in age, dating back 3.9 billion years before present. Its size corresponds roughly the size of Mauritius. It once contained a paleolake that was fed by large regional watersheds. Two inlet valleys, Neretva Vallis and Sava Vallis can be spotted, entering the crater in the northern and northeastern part (Viewpoint Inlet 1 and Inlet 2) and ending in the deltas (viewpoint Delta). Here, water-bearing clay minerals and particularly carbonates were discovered. These minerals have a high potential of conserving and retaining biosignatures over long time spans. The former presence of liquid water and the large carbonate deposits here make Jezero a perfect destination for the search for possible traces of presumabely extinct life on Mars.

The outflow channel Pliva Vallis (viewpoint Outflow channel) breaks through the eastern crater rim surpassing a swell. Using altitude measurements from crater rim, crater floor, swell and upper edge of the delta, the potential depth of the lake can be deduced, resulting in roughly 250 m water depth. This would result in a minimum lake water volume of 220 km3 and a maximum of 340 km3 (see corresponding images). However, as the deltas have been severely eroded since water activity ceased approximately 3.8 billion years ago, it is no longer possible to make precise assessments. Also, the crater was filled with very extensive lava flows from the nearby Syrtis Major volcanic region about 300 million years later.

The Mountain View viewpoint offers a perfect vista into the crater. This viewpoint is located on top of the large hill southeast of the crater. From here, the observer can see that the northern part of the crater floor is sloping and that the northern crater rim is clearly less defined, compared to the flat, smooth crater floor in the south and the much steeper southern crater rim flanks. This appearance originates from the erosion of material in the catchment areas to the north of the crater, which was then transported into the crater basin itself and deposited in the deltas. Also contributing to the asymmetrical topography is the erosion of the northern crater rim, caused by the river valleys breaking through the flank of Jezero.

### Image data
For the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover landing site or Jezero crater special PR release, a variety of data form the Mars Express (MEx) and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) were utilized. Base maps were created from panchromatic and RGB image data acquired by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) at an average ground resolution of 12.5 m/px and 25.0 m/px, respectively. From the nine individual orbits covering Jezero crater to the present day, we made use of the four level-4 (orthorectified on HRSC Digital Terrain Models (DTM)) archived and publicly available ones (h0988, h5252, h5270, and h7289) acquired in 2004, 2008 and 2009. Topographic information is taken from the bundle-adjusted level-5 HRSC-based DTM of the eastern half of the MC13 Syrtis Major quadrangle and is presented in deviations from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) gravity and laser altimeter analysis derived Mars areoid.
To get a more detailed impression of the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover landing site, a large number of higher resolution image data from the Context Camera (CTX) and the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on board MRO were incorporated. In total, 33 CTX swaths having an average resolution of 6 m/px were orthorectified and co-registered to lev-4 and lev-5 HRSC data by bundle adjustment, using the USGS Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) (https://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/). In a next step, these images were merged with the lower resolved HRSC-based RGB data to produce higher resolved pan-sharpened CTX-HRSC colour data.
